# GooGet

[![Go](https://github.com/google/googet/actions/workflows/go.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/google/googet/actions/workflows/go.yml)

GooGet (Googet's Obviously Only a Goofy Experimental Title) is a modular
package repository solution primarily designed for Windows.

GooGet is shipped with the official Google Cloud Platform Windows images and is
used to maintain the guest environment.

## Build

To build and package googet run

```
go run goopack/goopack.go googet.goospec
```

This will result in googet.exe and googet.x86_64.VERSION.goo which can be installed on a
machine with the `googet install` command (assuming googet is already
installed).

To install on a fresh machine copy both googet.exe and the googet package
over and run:

```
googet -root 'c:/ProgramData/GooGet' install googet googet.x86_64.VERSION.goo
```

## Conf file

GooGet has the ability to use a conf file to change a few of the default settings.
Place a file named googet.conf in the googet root, which by default is
`C:\ProgramData\GooGet` and configurable by the `-root` flag.


```
proxyserver: http://address_to_proxy:port
archs: [noarch, x86_64]
cachelife: 10m
installtimeout: 4h
```

`installtimeout` limits how long googet lets an installer, uninstaller or verify
command run before it and the processes it started are killed (default `4h`,
`0` disables it); goopack build steps always use the default. On Unix,
descendants that call setsid or setpgid leave the process group and escape. On
Windows, MSI and wusa work done by the Windows Installer service runs outside
the command's job and is not killed.

## Repo file

GooGet has the ability to use a repo file to change some repo specific settings.
The file is named your-repo-name.repo by default. It can be used to set the
source URL and indicate that the client should pass authorization headers in 
requests to the source URL.

```
URL: https://foo.com/googet/bar
  useoauth: true
```

## Google Cloud Storage as a back-end

Googet supports using Google Cloud Storage as its server.

```
set GOOREPO=%TEMP%\googet-repo
set REPONAME=my_repo
mkdir %GOOREPO%\%REPONAME%
mkdir %GOOREPO%\packages
go run goopack/goopack.go googet.goospec
copy *.goo %GOOREPO%\packages
go run server\gooserve.go -root %GOOREPO% -save_index %GOOREPO%\%REPONAME%\index
gcloud storage buckets create --project my-project gs://my-googet-server
gcloud storage rsync --recursive %GOOREPO% gs://my-googet-server
googet addrepo gcs gs://my-googet-server

rem This command should print 'gcs: gs://my-googet-server'
googet listrepos

rem This command should list the googet package and any other packages in your repo
googet available -sources gs://my-googet-server/

```

Note that you must regenerate the index and re-upload it to your bucket each time
you add or change packges.
